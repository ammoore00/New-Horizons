Datapack for Minecraft 1.18 aimed at adding depth and challenge to vanilla

# Tweaks to Vanilla
## Metals
Iron and gold are changed to produce only a single nugget from each piece of ore, and smelting takes significantly longer.

A blast furnace can also be used to reclaim an ingot from iron and gold tools, instead of a nugget. Reclamation is also expanded to include shears and shields.

Several recipes are also tweaked to account for the changes in accessibility to iron and gold.
- Clocks, compasses, and the flint and steel may now be crafted using nuggets instead of ingots.
- Buckets are now crafted with 7 nuggets in a U.
- Anvils are now crafted with 7 ingots instead of using blocks for the top row.
- Axes now only require 2 of their requisite material, omitting the item above the sticks.
- Hoppers are changed to use nuggets in the top and bottom rows instead of ingots. The middle row still uses ingots.
- Lanterns only require 4 ingots in a plus, and produce 2.

## Diamonds
Diamond ore now drops raw diamonds. These diamonds must be combined with an iron ingot on a smithing table in order to turn them into diamonds which can be used to make equipment.

Diamond equipment can also be smelted in a blast furnace in order to reclaim one of the diamonds used in their construction.

## Health and Hunger
Health regen has now been completely decoupled from hunger. Health no longer costs food to regen, but is much slower. Additionally, health will regen as long as your hunger is at or above half, instead of requiring it to be above 90%
