# New-Horizons
Datapack for Minecraft 1.18 aimed at adding depth and challenge to vanilla

# Tweaks to Vanilla
## Metals
Iron and gold are changed to produce only a single nugget from each piece of ore, and smelting takes significantly longer.

Iron and gold items can now be reclaimed for an ingot instead of a nugget, but reclaiming may now only be done in a blast furnace.

## Health and Hunger
Health regen has now been completely decoupled from hunger. Health no longer costs food to regen, but is much slower. Additionally, health will regen as long as your hunger is at or above half, instead of requiring it to be above 90%
